# Docker Image Builder

### version 1.0.1

This is a simple GNUmake Makefile (plus a couple of helper scripts) to 
help build Docker images and keep the need for long command-lines low.

To install use:

	(curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TrustifierLabs/docker-image-builder/v1.0.0/install.sh | bash)

# TODO 

* Support for docker-compose

* Remove perl dependencies for `make help`
