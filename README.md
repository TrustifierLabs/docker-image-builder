# Docker Image Builder

### version 1.0.0

This is a simple GNUmake Makefile (plus a couple of helper scripts) to 
help build Docker images and keep the need for long command-lines low.

# TODO 

* Support for docker-compose
* Add an install script that can be of the form:
	`curl -O https://github.com/TrustfierLabs/docker-image-builder/install.sh | bash `

* Remove perl dependencies for `make help`
